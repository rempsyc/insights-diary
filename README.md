# The Insights Diary

My (quite) personal blog. Archiving my working thoughts, reflections, and personal subjective experiences before they vanish into existence. Purposefully opinionated. Not peer-reviewed—possibly even barely self-reviewed—take with a grain of salt. Thoughts are just thoughts. Think critically, and please disagree, if you may.
