### Ideas to reflect on for future blog posts

1.  Addition to the deep listening blog: insights gained when listening during meditation: this is where I gain many (most?) of my insights and creativity. When I quiet the verbal mind and start listening, I start "hearing" what the non-verbal mind might have been saying for a while, but which I couldn't hear because I was thinking "too loud", therefore burying the sound of that "inner voice" which leads to the emergence of wisdom. I will, most typically, start remembering things that I had to do but which I had completely forgot to add to my to-do list. So it is very useful to stay accountable. In that state, I will sometimes also start remembering my dreams from the previous night. I will also get creative ideas and solutions to problems from my work or day-to-day life. Only possible because I create some space to listen to what is already there, but quiet.
2.  What is Enlightenment? (Spoiler: It's Not Perfection)
3.  Give up Productivity, embrace Fruitfulness
4.  Consolidation and curation: what we need more of, and the importance of clarity
5.  Is productivity linear? Investigation into contemporary claims of old literature
6.  One-set-a-day program
7.  Mapping: The Little Known Power of Defining System Boundaries

Mapping: The Little Known Power of Defining System Boundaries. I think or something like that. So not only mapping when I walk in new cities (classical understanding of a physical map), but also understanding structures and being generally exhaustive to understand a system. Same for studying (understanding how much materials, chapters, themes) for memory, ecosystems (R packages, options, and even for shopping products), also for bargaining, collecting data on prices for same items based on different vendors, understanding limits of bargaining. You remove ignorance and slowly build an internal map. Slow and systematic. But gives insight, and oh how powerful. Same for body map with Vipassana. It is a form of meta-cognition I guess. Like a “quick(er)” way to mastery rather than superficial learning (much better integration).
