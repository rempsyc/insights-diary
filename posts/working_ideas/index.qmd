### Ideas to reflect on for future blog posts

1.  Addition to the deep listening blog: insights gained when listening during meditation: this is where I gain many (most?) of my insights and creativity. When I quiet the verbal mind and start listening, I start "hearing" what the non-verbal mind might have been saying for a while, but which I couldn't hear because I was thinking "too loud", therefore burying the sound of that "inner voice" which leads to the emergence of wisdom. I will, most typically, start remembering things that I had to do but which I had completely forgot to add to my to-do list. So it is very useful to stay accountable. In that state, I will sometimes also start remembering my dreams from the previous night. I will also get creative ideas and solutions to problems from my work or day-to-day life. Only possible because I create some space to listen to what is already there, but quiet.
2.  What is Enlightenment? (Spoiler: It's Not Perfection)
3.  Give Up Productivity, Embrace Fruitfulness
4.  Consolidation and curation: what we need more of, and the importance of clarity
5.  Is productivity linear? Investigation into contemporary claims of old literature
6.  One-set-a-day program
7.  Mapping: The Little Known Power of Defining System Boundaries
8.  Key words of importance right now: fruitfulness, consolidation, curation, rigpa (awareness), rapture / pīti, Coherent Effortless Experience (CEEing) model (Lieberman, 2022)
9.  2026-01-17: I was sleeping and then it seems like my brain identified a smell that required further analysis, and so called my consciousness upon it, to investigate it. I was not aware of where or what I was, simply, the task was to analyze the nature of the smell to evaluate whether there was a danger or not. The analysis revealed that the smell was that of burnt toasts. I wondered, did I make burned toasts? No, I am sleeping. Could this be risk that something is burning? Please wake up, to investigate further. Woke up, and, it was a false alarm. Nothing was burning within the apartment, the smell must have come from outside.
10. My experience with Vipassana: and as well as implications for attention and awareness as distinct and dissociable processes, rigpa (pristine awareness). When I keep automatically doing the body scanning while sleeping, what exactly moves from the top of the head to the tips of the toes while I am not conscious or aware? What else but attention?
11. Reading text without "reading out loud in one's head", so non-verbal reading? Better for speed reading. Analogy with non-verbal thinking. Thinking without the need to think "out loud". Also related to reading: reading on auto-pilot while mind-wandering. Because reading is automatic. So not so good because I don't remember what I'm reading when accidentally entering this state. And YET even in this auto-pilot mode sometimes keywords of interest will "catch my attention" so-to-speak, and alert my consciousness of the relevance to stop and analyze the situation further.

Mapping: The Little Known Power of Defining System Boundaries. I think or something like that. So not only mapping when I walk in new cities (classical understanding of a physical map), but also understanding structures and being generally exhaustive to understand a system. Same for studying (understanding how much materials, chapters, themes) for memory, ecosystems (R packages, options, and even for shopping products), also for bargaining, collecting data on prices for same items based on different vendors, understanding limits of bargaining. You remove ignorance and slowly build an internal map. Slow and systematic. But gives insight, and oh how powerful. Same for body map with Vipassana. It is a form of meta-cognition I guess. Like a “quick(er)” way to mastery rather than superficial learning (much better integration).
