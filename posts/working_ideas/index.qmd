### Ideas to reflect on for future blog posts

1.  What is Enlightenment? (Spoiler: It's Not Perfection)
2.  Give up Productivity, embrace Fruitfulness
3.  Consolidation and curation: what we need more of, and the importance of clarity
4.  Is productivity linear? Investigation into contemporary claims of old literature
5.  One-set-a-day program
6.  Mapping: The Little Known Power of Defining System Boundaries

Mapping: The Little Known Power of Defining System Boundaries. I think or something like that. So not only mapping when I walk in new cities (classical understanding of a physical map), but also understanding structures and being generally exhaustive to understand a system. Same for studying (understanding how much materials, chapters, themes) for memory, ecosystems (R packages, options, and even for shopping products), also for bargaining, collecting data on prices for same items based on different vendors, understanding limits of bargaining. You remove ignorance and slowly build an internal map. Slow and systematic. But gives insight, and oh how powerful. Same for body map with Vipassana. It is a form of meta-cognition I guess. Like a “quick(er)” way to mastery rather than superficial learning (much better integration).
