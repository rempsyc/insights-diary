### Ideas to reflect on for future blog posts

1.  What is Enlightenment? (Spoiler: It's Not Perfection)
2.  Letting go of productivity in favor of fruitfulness
3.  Consolidation and curation: what we need more of, and the importance of clarity
4.  Is productivity linear? Investigation into contemporary claims of old literature
