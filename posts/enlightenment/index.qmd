### What is Enlightenment? (Spoiler: It's Not Perfection)

My vision of enlightenment has been shattered. I saw enlightenment as the attainment of perfection. Not only spiritually so, but also intellectually. I thought being Enlightened meant that it is no more possible to do mistakes. To hit your small toe on the corner of a table. To forget someone's name. To make a typo. To make errors of perception or judgment. But is it really so?
