    "text": "Writing this, I am here in Varanasi, reflecting on death and impermanence at the Ganges’ Dashashwamedh Ghat for the Aarti ritual. This is part of a three-week trip in India where I am visiting a lot of holy spiritual Buddhist and Hindu sites, and it’s bringing me a lot of higher-level reflections, including on the nature of intuition and consciousness.\n\n\n\nAarti Ritual at the Assi Ghat in Varanasi\n\n\nOne thing that I’ve been thinking about is finding a medium to communicate my ideas and reflections about listening as a state of consciousness. In fact, I’m thinking maybe I should publish a book, probably boringly called, “Listen” (it’s probably already taken, though).\nI think what I’m trying to do here is to expand people’s lay understanding of listening. I don’t mean listening only in the sense of “listen to what people are telling you” or “empathetic listening”. I also mean it in the sense of “listen to the social and physical cues in your environment”, “listen to your intuition and your unconscious brain”, and even, “listen to what life is trying to tell you, through coincidences and synchronicities, whatever it might be”. It is also as a way to see mindfulness and paying attention more generally as a form of “listening”. So perhaps we could talk about “deep listening”, in the sense of listening to cues that are usually too subtle to detect, but that nonetheless carry rich and useful information. This might make you better at pattern detection.\nI’m feeling ambitious these days. I also want to write about “The Integrated Self” or something like that. Like mindfulness integrating different parts of the self / brain, mirroring gamma synchrony during mindfulness (Lutz et al., 2004). Perhaps it could be part of the same book (listening to one’s intuition helps get a more integrated self with the non-verbal side of the brain). I’m not sure how the book will turn out or how exactly all the pieces of the puzzle fit in just yet, but I get excited at the idea of writing about this because writing helps clarify thinking, too. And I feel like I have a lot of organization to do with these ideas.\nYes, the integrated self book will be about integrating the left and right hemispheres, the verbal consciousness with the non-verbal one. I know most of us still have an intact corpus callosum, but I still think different brain regions are not as harmoniously integrated by default as they could be, but that this can be learned or developed. Perhaps it could fit in the same book as “Listen”, or a different book, I’ll see.\nNow, what do I mean by the “integrated self”? For example, waking up before your alarm, waking up before your bus stop, waking up when the meal cart is nearby during your flight while others are still sleeping (somehow there’s some sort of sensory filtering going on, and you just get woken up for relevant stimuli)."

But the thought wasn’t necessary; the sensation was more than enough. It had, from the outset, given me all the necessary information. The thought only served to repeat what I already knew in every cell of my being, and to weigh down and overwhelm my helpless mind…\n\n↩︎"
