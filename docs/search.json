    "text": "Writing this, I am here in Varanasi, reflecting on death and impermanence at the Ganges’ Dashashwamedh Ghat for the Aarti ritual. This is part of a three-week trip in India where I am visiting a lot of holy spiritual Buddhist and Hindu sites, and it’s bringing me a lot of higher-level reflections, including on the nature of intuition and consciousness.\n\n\n\nAarti Ritual at the Assi Ghat in Varanasi\n\n\nOne thing that I’ve been thinking about is finding a medium to communicate my ideas and reflections about listening as a state of consciousness. In fact, I’m thinking maybe I should publish a book, probably boringly called, “Listen” (it’s probably already taken, though).\nI think what I’m trying to do is to expand people’s lay understanding of the concept of listening. I don’t mean listening only in the sense of “listen to what people are telling you” or “empathetic listening”. I also mean it in the sense of “listen to the social and physical cues in your environment”, “listen to your intuition and your unconscious brain”, and even, “listen to what life is trying to tell you, through whatever coincidences and synchronicities arise”. It is also as a way to see mindfulness and paying attention more generally as a form of “listening”. So perhaps we could talk about “deep listening”, in the sense of listening to cues that are usually too subtle to detect, but that nonetheless carry rich and useful information. This might make you better at pattern detection.\nI’m feeling ambitious these days. I also want to write about “The Integrated Self”, or something like that. Like mindfulness integrating different parts of the self / brain, mirroring gamma synchrony during mindfulness (Lutz et al., 2004). Perhaps it could be part of the same book (i.e., listening to one’s intuition helps get a more integrated self with the non-verbal side of the brain)1.\nSo, yes, the integrated self book will be about integrating the left and right hemispheres, the verbal consciousness with the non-verbal one, discussing the implications of a severed corpus callosum—the arc-like bundle of nerves at the middle of the brain that bridges the two hemispheres2. I know most of us still have an intact corpus callosum, but I still think different brain regions are not as harmoniously integrated by default as they could be, and that this can be learned or developed. Perhaps it could fit in the same book as “Listen”, or a different book, I’ll see.\nNow, what do I mean by the “integrated self”? I am talking about an harmonious integration of conscious / controlled and unconscious / automatic processes. The way we discuss this in psychology is typically as “System 1” (fast and automatic) and “System 2” (slow and controlled), and we describe those two systems as usually well-integrated. However, my assertion is that we all have a hidden potential that is, for the most part, “untapped”, but that can be discovered by using system 2 to pay attention to system 1.\nSome of this inter-system activity is also already automatic, and perhaps even harmonious, especially in the case of well-developed habits. You might have already realized that with good sleep habits, you may start to wake-up right before your alarm clock, hinting at some kind of internal clock. Similarly, after training myself to take power naps of 20 minutes (with a timer), I find that now I frequently wake-up right before the 20 minutes is up. As I progressively regain consciousness, I can feel my heart beat, body sensations, and mental activity slowly going back to normal. Still that internal clock getting some work done.\nSometimes, however, that internal clock might work even in non-habitual contexts. For me, for instance, it used to take the form of waking up before my bus stop, as I would fall asleep during the ride, being too exhausted from long school days. Clearly, given that this decision is accurate, the “decision” of your unconscious brain to wake you up at a particular point in time must be based on something. At times, this can be the internal clock, but at other times, this might be due to external stimuli within the environment."

And I feel like I have a lot of organization to do with these ideas.↩︎\nThe impressive body of literature which I should review and fact-check↩︎\nThere is a nice paper which I’d like to discuss which describes how in schizophrenia, some of the “walls” connecting non-conscious but still verbal processing areas break down so all these usually unconscious thoughts actually find their way to consciousness, which can, obviously, be debilitating.↩︎\nNeed to add the references for this↩︎\nThis seems to be related to “exogenous attention”, the literature which I should also review.↩︎\nI found back a 2011 Facebook post of mine in which I had written (translated from French),\n\nThe sensation came first, then the thought. But the thought wasn’t necessary; the sensation was more than enough. It had, from the outset, given me all the necessary information. The thought only served to repeat what I already knew in every cell of my being, and to weigh down and overwhelm my helpless mind…\n\n↩︎\nI should also look deeper into pre-reflective processes and the Coherent Effortless Experience (CEEing) model specifically (Lieberman, 2022).↩︎"
